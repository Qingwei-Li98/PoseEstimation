# PoseEstimate

This is Qingwei Li's individual Project. 
The method gives a solution of pose estimation. The model is firstly trained on Human3.6M dataset and then finetuned on MAVEHA infant data. The model is able to generate 2D joint positions as well as 3D coordinates in camera coordinate system, and generate reconstruction frame given a 2D pose and an unpaired frame image.
